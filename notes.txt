idea for challenges

different pages, devoted
to different characters
that want you to make
stuff for them, and usually
themed, like one will have
to do with a screen device,
one will have to do with just
like math or something, one
will have to do with text,
and you can even combine some!
wow, first page is BOOTCAMP
but you start to unlock other
as you go thru bootcamp so its
not a slog. use what you know
at any given point.
